These words in this order just make no sense to me. Computers themselves never would be under any kind of license. I'm not sure if Mr Doyle is implying that everything that is produced on that computer would be covered by an open source license -- it's one of the interpretations of this gibberish I suppose. I have an open source project open in another window as I'm writing this piece, but that doesn't mean I need to release this scathing quote under an MIT license and invite contributions (although I might).
